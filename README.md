##Purpose
=========
Last year, when I was studying ios-development, the White House's iOS App helped me so much.I konw open source is a good way to improve myself and help some newer.What's more sharing the code may let us communicate with each other usefully.<br />
Finally, you can add more functions for the app if you want.

##Attention
===========
there are some ***notifications*** that you should notice list below:
> (1) the app's running-environment at least iOS **5.1**, so it supports iOS version is:5.1+<br />
> (2) the app **doesn't** support iPhone 5's screen size, it means the app is better for iPhone 4 and 4S.<br />
> (3) it **doesn't** support [douban](http://www.douban.com/) now.<br />
> (4) because of sina weibo's ***policy***, the app also **doesn't** support synchronous to sina weibo.
